<!-- paragraph of class expectations -->
<h4>
I am very excited (and a little nervous) for IS 413. I do not consider myself a naturally
gifted coder, so I know this class will be a bit of a challenge for me. My main goal for this
class is to gain more confidence when it comes to writing code and solving complex programming
problems. In addition, I hope to gain a better understanding of how compiled languages work so
that I can translate my C# knowledge over to other languages.
